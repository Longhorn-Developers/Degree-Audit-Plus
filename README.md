# UT Degree Audit Plus ✨

An unofficial Chrome extension designed to enhance and modernize the degree planning experience for students at the University of Texas at Austin.

## The Problem

The official degree audit system is powerful but can be difficult to read, non-interactive, and challenging for long-term planning.ee Audit Plus aims to solve this by transforming the static audit page into a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly dashboard through an extension.

## Key Features (to be implemented)

  * ** Interactive Dashboard:** Replaces the default audit layout with a clean, modern interface that visualizes your degree progress.
  * ** Dynamic Checklists:** See exactly which requirements you've fulfilled and what's left to complete for your majors, minors, and certificates.
  * ** What-If Scenarios:** Experiment with adding a minor or changing majors to instantly see how it would affect your graduation requirements.
  * ** Prerequisite Visualization:** A clear, graphical view of course dependencies so you never register for a class out of sequence.
  * ** Four-Year Planner:** Drag and drop courses into a semester-by-semester plan to build a clear roadmap to graduation.
  * ** Secure & Private:** The extension runs entirely in your local browser. Your academic data is never sent to, stored on, or seen by any external server.

## Tech Stack

  * **Frontend:** React, TypeScript
  * **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
  * **State Management:** Redux Toolkit
  * **Backend & Data:** Supabase (for storing user-created plans)
  * **Platform:** Chrome Extension API (Manifest V3)
  * **Build Tools:** WXT, Vite, Node.js
